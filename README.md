This is the game of Parchessi and Final Proyect of the class of Advanced

What is Parchessi?
Parcheesi is the brand name American adaptation of the Indian cross and circle board game Pachisi which it was published by Parker Brothers and Winning Moves , is a game for 2-4 players. It requires a multi-colored board, 16 playing pieces, and two dice.

What do I want to get better in the program?

In this game I learned more about the theme of class at first it was difficult to me but I learned a lot with this game.I did this game with Brenda Flores we analize and learn about this and have fun drawing the board of Parchessi. It took us a lot of time creating this. There are still things I want to get better in this proyect like example:

a. Do a shortest program 
b. Learn more about the structure of this game
c. Get better on the movements of the game

We used a some reference.
